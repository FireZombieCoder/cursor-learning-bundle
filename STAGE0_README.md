- Access control with owner pattern

### [SimpleStorage.sol](./contracts/stage0/SimpleStorage.sol)
A more complex contract showing:
- Storage vs memory vs calldata
- Structs and mappings
- Modifiers and access control
- Complex data types

## üß™ Tests

### [HelloBase.t.sol](./test/stage0/HelloBase.t.sol)
Comprehensive tests covering:
- Initial state verification
- Function behavior testing
- Error condition testing
- Event emission verification
- Gas usage analysis
- Fuzz testing

### [SimpleStorage.t.sol](./test/stage0/SimpleStorage.t.sol)
Advanced tests including:
- Complex state management
- Access control testing
- Event verification
- Gas optimization validation

## üêç Python Tools

### [hello_base.py](./python/stage0/hello_base.py)
A complete Python client for interacting with the HelloBase contract:
- Contract state reading
- Transaction sending
- Event monitoring
- Error handling

### [cli.py](./python/stage0/cli.py)
A user-friendly command-line interface:
- Contract information display
- Message updating
- Event history viewing
- Balance checking

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r python/requirements.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your private key and RPC URL
```

### 2. Get Testnet ETH
Visit the [Base faucet](https://docs.base.org/docs/tools/network-faucets/) to get testnet ETH.

### 3. Deploy Contracts
```bash
# Deploy HelloBase contract
forge script script/DeployHelloBase.s.sol:DeployHelloBase \
    --rpc-url base_sepolia \
    --broadcast \
    --verify

# Deploy SimpleStorage contract
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol:DeploySimpleStorage \
    --rpc-url base_sepolia \
    --broadcast \
    --verify
```

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run with gas report
forge test --gas-report

# Run specific test
forge test --match-test testUpdateMessage
```

### 5. Use Python CLI
```bash
# Get contract info
python python/stage0/cli.py info <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>

# Update message (if you're the owner)
python python/stage0/cli.py update <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "New Message"

# View events
python python/stage0/cli.py events <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

## üìä Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Contract Interaction
1. Deploy the HelloBase contract
2. Read the initial message
3. Update the message (if you're the owner)
4. Verify the change

### Exercise 2: Python Integration
1. Use the Python CLI to interact with your contract
2. Monitor events using the events command
3. Check your account balance

### Exercise 3: Gas Optimization
1. Analyze gas usage in the test output
2. Try to optimize the SimpleStorage contract
3. Compare gas usage before and after optimization
